# MasteringCuTe
How does one learn and master CuTe ?

Step 1 : Look at existing [documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/media/docs/cute)
* Run standalone CuTe examples to learn the basics
* Addtionally checkout other online content like this CUDA Mode [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6q719ck7ww) or [this blog](https://leimao.github.io/article/CuTe-Layout-Algebra/) from Lei Mao
* If interested read up about [CuTe Algebra](https://research.colfax-intl.com/a-note-on-the-algebra-of-cute-layouts/)
  * Honestly, this is too much Math for my liking, but may be not for everyone.


STEP 2 : Read Colfax blog posts - which are gentle inroduction into real world applications
* [Matrix Transpose](https://research.colfax-intl.com/tutorial-matrix-transpose-in-cutlass/)
  * Another great [blog on Transpose](https://leimao.github.io/article/CuTe-Matrix-Transpose/) using CuTe is from Lei Mao
* [TMA](https://research.colfax-intl.com/tutorial-hopper-tma/)
* [GEMM](https://research.colfax-intl.com/cutlass-tutorial-wgmma-hopper/) & [GEMM Optimized](https://research.colfax-intl.com/cutlass-tutorial-design-of-a-gemm-kernel/)
  * Take your time on this one !
